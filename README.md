<h1> In the Processs.............</h1>

I'm building a full-stack AI-powered interview preparation platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Tailwind CSS for sleek and responsive UI. It offers intelligent mock interviews, real-time feedback, and personalized question sets to help users prepare effectively.
